.Sh NAME
.Nm timelim
.Nd A program capable of setting ridiculous time limits
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl jsSvV
number[suffix]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Timelim
is an implementation of the
.Nm sleep(1)
utility capable of setting time limits as short as a
few nanoseconds or as long as multiple centuries.
.Nm Timelim
will accept floating point arguments, but they will be
processed as integers internally with the decimal being used as a delimiter.
.sp
.Nm Timelim
accepts the following flags:
.sp
.Nm -j, --julian
This causes
.Nm Timelim
to use the Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar.
.sp
.Nm -s, --signal
.Nm Timelim
will function as normal until it receives a POSIX signal or SIGINFO,
which will then cause it finish execution with an exit status of zero.
If no argument is given or the argument is zero,
.Nm Timelim
will wait indefinitely wait for a signal without timing out.
This option was implemented for compatibility with the
.Nm ksh93(1)
sleep builtin.
.sp
.Nm -S, --sidereal
This causes
.Nm Timelim
to use the Sidereal year instead of the Gregorian year.
.sp
.Nm -v, --verbose
This will cause
.Nm Timelim
to print out the number of seconds and nanoseconds it will wait for,
then output `Time's up!` when finished.
.sp
.Nm -V, --version
Prints the version of
.Nm Timelim
currently installed on the machine.
.sp
.Nm -?, --help
Shows usage information regarding
.Nm Timelim .
.sp
.Nm Timelim
will also accept the following suffixes appended to arguments:
.sp
.Nm n
Nanoseconds (cannot be a floating point)
.sp
.Nm u
Microseconds (cannot be a floating point)
.sp
.Nm l
Milliseconds (cannot be a floating point)
.sp
.Nm s
Seconds (same as no suffix)
.sp
.Nm m
Minutes
.sp
.Nm h
Hours
.sp
.Nm d
Days
.sp
.Nm w
Weeks
.sp
.Nm f
Fortnights (2 weeks)
.sp
.Nm o
Months (equal to `year / 12`, see below)
.sp
.Nm y
Denotes years (defaults to 31556952 seconds, passing
.Nm --sidereal
changes this to 31558150 seconds, passing
.Nm --julian
changes this to 31557600 seconds)
.sp
.Nm x
Decades
.sp
.Nm c
Centuries
.sp
.Nm a
Millennia
.sp
If
.Nm Timelim
is sent SIGPWR or SIGINFO, it will show the user how
many seconds and nanoseconds are remaining until
.Nm Timelim
finishes execution.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Sleep for 2 seconds with verbose output (when run as sleep):
sleep -v 2 or sleep -v 2s
.sp
Sleep for 4 months, 1 fortnight, 2 weeks and 2000
nanoseconds (with verbose output, suffixes):
timelim --verbose 4m 1f 2w 2000n
.sp
Sleep for 7 millennia and a month, using the Julian calendar:
timelim -j 7a 1o
.sp
Set a time limit to last a minute unless a signal is received:
timelim -s 1m or ./timelim -s 60s
.sp
Set a time limit to last one sidereal year and three weeks:
timelim -S 1y 3w
.sp
Set a time limit to only last 24000 nanoseconds:
timelim 24000n
.sp
Set a time limit to last 3.6 centuries, 2.4 decades and 4.1 months:
timelim 3.6c 2.4x 4.1o
